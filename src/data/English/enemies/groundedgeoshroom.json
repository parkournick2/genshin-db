When one considers that Fungi evolved from spores, perhaps this one might even be the foundation for a further evolution into some new life form altogether â€” if given time, that is.\nThis creature has a position of command amongst colonies of fungal beasts and exhibits heightened intelligence to match.",

While in either one of said states, the Fungus will drop special materials</color>\\nIt is said the infestation of Fungi is the result of a lab accident. The first Sumeru Sage had wanted to utilize spores for medical purposes. If that is true, the person had clearly underestimated the spores' adaptive and reproductive powers."
