Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.\nIn ancient days, these heavily-equipped warriors were the domain of the personal, trusted guards of the Lord of the Blazing Sun. It is perhaps on this account that they gleam like the golden sun itself to this day.\nOminous, fragmented spirits are sealed within the weapons they use, awakening in moments of peril. Once these weapons awaken, they can only be silenced by the cries of the vanquished â€” whether that be their wielders or their wielders' foes.",

Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.\\n\"The Eremites\" is an umbrella term that people from outside the desert have coined for them. But beneath this name, there are separate entities such as the sellsword group known as the Farrokhzadan and the tribe of Tanit.\\nAs a people led not by gods, most of these desert descendants wield their blades to make a living and offer their skills to those who pay."
