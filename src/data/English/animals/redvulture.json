	"description": "This large bird consumes remains, and its red feathers often seem a little sparse under the sunlight.\nThese members of the eagle family are not actually native to the desert, instead appearing in the desert after the disappearance of the ancient civilization ruled by King Deshret. They have also come to be seen as harbingers of death or disaster by some migrants from the desert due to their unique living habits.",
